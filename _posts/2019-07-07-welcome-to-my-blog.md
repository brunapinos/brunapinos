Hello everyone, welcome to my blog! 

I create this blog to post about my work experience, some contents that I produce or think that are relevant. 
To introduce myself, I'm a software engineering student, and I work with chatbots! I tend to work a lot with open source projects and contribute as I can with the FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) community.

Those firsts posts will be about my experience in participating in Google Summer of Code with TensorFlow. I will explain how I wrote my proposal, communicate with the mentors, strugglings, and of course, about my project and TensorFlow.

I hope you enjoy the future posts and that they can be relevant!
