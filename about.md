I am Software Engineering student at University of Bras√≠lia - Brazil. I have experience developing FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) in various languages, such as Python, Java, and Ruby, always applying good practices of software engineering.

I have been an intern of [LAPPIS](https://lappis.rocks/) for the 2017-2019; a software engineering research laboratory focused on applied research on DevOps and open source. LAPPIS professors encourage a collaborative effort between teachers and students to contribute actively to Free Software communities, and use of Agile practices.

Part of my interest is Deep Learning, project management, chatbots and FLOSS good practices, specially chatbot, because it is a growing area in software development, where I can contribute with big things.

Also, currently (2019), I am participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5759303842004992) as Student Developer for [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/).
